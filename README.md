# IT-resource-list
This is an unofficial list of resources that may be of benefit to people attending WGU School of Information Technology

All resources listed have been vetted by two reviewers. We do our best to find any copyrighted material. We are only human and may err. If you find a resource listed that has a claim of ownership and copyright, please submit an issue and it will be dealt with accordingly.

# How to contribute

Please ensure the resource you'd like to contirube does not have a claim of ownership and copyright. Fork the repo first. You can find this option towards the upper right of the screen. After you've forked the repo, add the resource to the appropriate folder corresponding to the class in which it will most benefit. If a folder does not already exist for the class, you may create one first. Once you are finished making changes, submit a PR. From here please wait for two reviewers to look over the changes. If two reviewers find the changes to be appropriate, the changes will be reflected on this repo. If there is reason not to accept the changes, this will not be accepted. You may comment from within the PR request why your changes are valid and not of copyright concern. The reviewers will have the final say.
