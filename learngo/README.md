# A Huge Number of Go Examples, Exercises and Quizzes

Best way of learning is doing. Inside this repository, you will find thousands of Go examples, exercises and quizzes.

I initially created this repository for my [Learn Go Programming: Complete Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-go-the-complete-bootcamp-course-golang/?referralCode=5CE6EB34E2B1EF4A7D37). Later on, I added a lot of exercises, and I wanted every programmer who are not yet enrolled in the course to learn for free as well. So here it is. Enjoy.

**ðŸ‘‰ Enroll in the course with this [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-go-the-complete-bootcamp-course-golang/?referralCode=5CE6EB34E2B1EF4A7D37).**
